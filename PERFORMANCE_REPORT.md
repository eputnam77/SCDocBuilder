# Performance Analysis Report

Profiling attempts for the project failed because required dependencies (e.g. `python-docx`) could not be installed in the offline environment. Therefore no runtime profile data was captured.

## Recommendations

| Recommendation | Impact | Effort | Risk | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Precompile regex pattern used in `apply_conditionals` | Low CPU overhead reduction, small speed improvement | Trivial | Low | P1 |
| Cache frequently used field mappings as module constants | Slight performance gain when parsing worksheets | Trivial | Low | P2 |
| Consider async file handling in API endpoints | Better scalability for concurrent uploads | Moderate | Medium | P3 |
| Benchmark processing with 500 KB–1 MB DOCX files once dependencies available | Ensures T-024 threshold (<1s) is met | Medium | Low | P2 |
| Add k6 load tests for `/generate` when k6 available | Helps detect regressions under load | Moderate | Low | P2 |

### Applied Tweaks

- Precompiled the conditional block regex as a module constant in `processing.py` for minor speed improvement.

## Notes

- Tests and profiling did not run because the environment lacks `python-docx` and network access is disabled.
- Profiling artifacts directory has been created at `perf/artifacts/`.
