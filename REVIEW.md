# Review of recent changes

## PRD Compliance

- **Functional requirements** F1–F6, F8–F9 are implemented in the CLI. Argument parsing shows required options and flags【F:src/faa_sc_replacer/cli.py†L27-L47】. Placeholder replacement and conditional blocks traverse all parts of the document【F:src/faa_sc_replacer/processing.py†L30-L147】. Output filenames are auto-generated when `--output` is omitted【F:src/faa_sc_replacer/__init__.py†L45-L48】.
- **F7 (download link in web UI)** is not implemented; only CLI support exists.
- **Non-functional requirements**: coverage is above 90% (95% from tests)【16a1b2†L11-L22】. Input validation checks file type and size but does not verify worksheet fields【F:src/faa_sc_replacer/io.py†L13-L22】.

## Integration

- Tests pass on Python 3.12 (30 tests) with coverage 95%【16a1b2†L11-L22】.
- Linting, formatting, and type checks succeed after fixing test files.
- Bandit finds no issues【7fdd85†L1-L25】. Semgrep failed due to network restrictions.

## Performance

- No regressions measured. Placeholder replacement loops may scale poorly on large documents, as noted previously. Regex for conditional blocks is recompiled each call【F:src/faa_sc_replacer/processing.py†L104-L111】.

## Maintainability

- Code structure remains modular with simple helper functions. Tests have been expanded (e.g., full DOCX traversal)【F:tests/test_processing_extra.py†L56-L109】.
- CI workflow (`agents.yml.disabled`) remains disabled; enabling it would enforce quality gates.

## Blocking Issues 🔴

1. F7 (web download link) and FastAPI endpoints (PRD section 8a) remain unimplemented.
2. Validation does not enforce mandatory worksheet fields (PRD §10).
3. Semgrep scan could not run due to network restrictions. Provide offline config or skip in CI.

## Info Comments 🟢

- Consider precompiling the conditional regex for slight speed boost.
- README lacks usage examples and contribution guidelines (task T-019).
- GitHub Actions workflow should be enabled for automated tests (task T-018).
