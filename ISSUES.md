# Test Results

- **Lock check**: `poetry check --lock` succeeded but `pip-compile --dry-run` failed because `pip-compile` is not installed (no internet access).
- **Type checking**: `mypy` reported no issues.
- **Tests**: all tests passed (`18 passed`) with coverage **87%**.
- **Coverage HTML**: generated and zipped into `coverage-html.zip` but `gh` CLI not installed so artifact upload skipped.

No code issues detected.
